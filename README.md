## Exercise 4
Implementation of forward and back progagation algorithms with regularized cost functions to make a neural network learn from the date given.

## Exercise 7 
Implementation of K Means for compressing an Image and PCA to perform Dimensionality Reduction. The linear algebra is easier thanks to the SVD function on MatLab that obtains the eigenvectors.
